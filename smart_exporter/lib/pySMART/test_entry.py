represent individual entries in a `Device`'s SMART Self-test Log.
"""
class Test_Entry(object):

    Contains all of the information associated with a single SMART Self-test
    log entry. This data is intended to exactly mirror that obtained through
    smartctl.

        **(str):** Entry's position in the log from 1 (most recent) to 21
        (least recent).  ATA logs save the last 21 entries while SCSI logs
        only save the last 20.

        """
        **(str):** Indicates the first LBA at which an error was encountered
        during this self-test. Presented as a decimal value for ATA/SATA devices
        and in hexadecimal notation for SAS/SCSI devices.

        """
        **(str):** Percentage value indicating how much of the self-test is
        left to perform. '00%' indicates a complete test, while any other
        value could indicate a test in progress or one that failed prior to
        completion. Only reported by ATA devices.

        """
        **(str):** A manufacturer-specific self-test segment number reported
